  <h1>PHNOM PENH</h1>
  <img src="pp.jpeg">
  <p>Phnom Penh’s streets bustle with charm. The Cambodian capital offers plentiful history, architecture, food and culture, all wrapped up in the hectic, vibrant atmosphere you’d expect from a major Asian city. While Cambodia’s tumultuous past is on full display in Phnom Penh, the city is moving on and embracing a bright future.

Spend a few days wandering the laneways, avenues and quays, soaking up sights like the Royal Palace, the Central Market and National Museum. Indulge in Phnom Penh’s buzzing food scene, combining fine dining, traditional dishes and a healthy dose of innovation, or relax in one of the many spas that can be found throughout the city.</p>
